This repo contains a bunch of code and files I have created, collected, or modified during my
research as a member of the Del Maestro condensed matter research group. This is my personal
branch of all the code used and maintained by the group, and is definitely not in sync with 
master branch. I make no guarantees about the quality or useability of my code as it was all 
designed for personal use. Most of my scripts are well commented but thorough, official
documentation does not yet exist. Please point your browser to to www.delmaestro.org/adrian for 
more information about our group, and to code.delmaestro.org for installation and useage 
instructions on the PIMC code. If you wish to use any of this code for your own research, 
please contact myself at kyle.wesley@me.com and my research advisor at Adrian.DelMaestro@uvm.edu. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Dr. Adrian Del Maestro, Associate Proffesor at the University of Vermont, 
is the primary author of the PIMC codebase and most of the scripts in this repo. I am merely
a contributor that made additions to handle my particular area of research and facilitate 
my own workflow. Author information can be found in the header of most files.
